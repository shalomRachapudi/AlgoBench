        <h1>Quick Help!</h1>
        <p>This is a quick help on the <strong>New Task</strong> section.</p>
        <h2>Sorting</h2>
        <p>
            Sorting has <strong>Quicksort</strong> and <strong>Heapsort</strong>. You
            can set the type of distribution that the input values will have, which are
            <em>random</em>, <em>sorted</em>, <em>reverse-sorted</em>, and <em>repeated values</em>, 
            Additionally, for <strong>Quicksort</strong> you can set <em>worst-case</em> input too, 
            as we know that <strong>Quicksort</strong> has a bad worst-case runtime. Note that the
            input that generates the worst-case is different, depending on the <strong>pivot</strong>
            type that we select. A good exercise is to work out what these input distributions are, and
            supply them to <em>AlgoBench</em> to see if it truly is the worst-case distribution. 
        </p>
        <h2>Graphs</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>BFS</strong> and <strong>DFS</strong> graph algorithms are implemented.
            In order to run them, one parameter must be fixed and the other varied
            over the course of execution of the algorithm. The parameter can either be 
            <strong>number of vertices</strong> or <strong>number of edges</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fixing number of vertices means the number of edges will range from <strong>initial size</strong>
            to <strong>final size</strong> in increments of <strong>increment size</strong>, up to a limit
            less than or equal to a certain number, depending on the number of vertices we set as the fixed
            parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The table below shows the constraints for the different possible kinds of graph. Deriving them is
            left as an exercise.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>A word about Graphs:</strong> Graph sizes need to be really large (up to tens of millions of
            edges) to get reasonable running times (above the millisecond range).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Size Hints:</strong> To run the graph, a good setting that would
            be run in reasonable time and yield reasonable results for an undirected, no-self-loops graph is:</p>

        <h2>Hashing</h2>
        <p>Hashing has <strong>"good hash"</strong> and <strong>"bad hash"</strong> functions. Details of the
            function can be seen by examining the source code. <img width="32" height="32" src="img/wink.png" alt="wink"/>
        </p>
        <p>(It's here, just in case: <strong>https://bitbucket.org/prof_zeezy/algobench_b.</strong> Look for <em>Hashing.h</em>)</p>
        <p>
            Using <strong>letters</strong> as the keys generates "A", "B", ..., "AA", "AB", etc as the keys.
            Using <strong>numbers</strong> generates keys from zero (0) up to the size of hash minus one.
        </p>     
        <br/>

        <h2>General Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The maximum value allowed for any parameter is the size of an unsigned 32-bit integer minus one, i.e.
                2^32 - 1 or 4,294,967,295. No negative values are allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the number of repeats for any step in an algorithm, the maximum is 10 (ten). No negative numbers
                are allowed.
            </li>
        </ul>
